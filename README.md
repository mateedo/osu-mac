# osu-mac
on mac, you are unable to download osu!. as such I downloaded mcOsu and found out the hard way that osu! has a built in processor of new beatmaps and skins. as such this bash
script should mimic the same behaviour without the flexibility of knowing where your osu! folder is all the time. the script assumes your songs folder is in `~/documents` and
that the script is in `~/downloads`. if you want to change this just edit the paths in the script and will work perfectly.
